LAB 1 Game of Life
{
British mathematician John Conway created the Game of Life in 1970. The game is a cellular automaton and a zero-player game where the evolution is determined by its initial state.
100/100, everything works perfectly fine the way it was intended, the cells move the way they are supposed to and the code is written well enough with comments that explain everything happening in the code showing I understand what is happening and what I wrote down.
The game of life follows simple rules that make cells come to life and work together moving around, with my code the game of life was replicated and does what is intended for the code to do.

LAB 2 Point distance
{
This point distance assignment was created in order to find the closest distance from the point the user enters from a random set of points. 100/100 the code finds the nearest point, and although I cant test if the code works with the test due to the MacBook I have I think I should be given full points, unless the instructor makes test for mac and I can revise and fix the code if there is anything wrong. This Lab was a lot easier to understand then Lab 1, I was able to make my own code and follow along on what the instructions were. The code does what its intended to do and works fine(aside from tests).

HW1 Movie Database
(
This project is designed to help us learn how arrays can be used alongside classes to store and modify datat, then homework helped me understand how to properly use classes and search through an array of pointers that point to a class that houses a lot of information. This database has a UI to help navigate what the user wants to do with a file full of information, you can add and delete movies one by one and can print the movies, and even search the entire movie list for a speific movie or genre of movies, and even make a csv file and print out the movie list to the file. I think I built this project very well and its almost beautiful how well it works and deserves a 100/100.

Lab3 Fraction Calculator
{
This Lab was very fun, it was easy once you understand how to access the fractions and which fraction numerator and denominator is which, once you grasp the concept making the calculator is very easy and its simple, this project helped me understand even more on how to access functions of sepcific class types. The project was also cool because of the override functions, the cout statements and the + - being changed to be a function was very interesting. This fraction calculator lets you input two fractions and then ouputs the two fractions added, subtracted, multplied and divided, all the test cases pass and the code is a little rough but it works well and is very easy to read, meaning i deserve a 100/100.

Lab5
{
   I used chat gpt to understnad how to do and start some of the code, but majority was does done by me and getting help from others.Majority of the code was very easy to understand, the biggest trouble was with remove data and insert node, keeping track of the node you have and recursion made things very difficult and caused me a lot of trouble, aside from tbose two the rest of the code was very easy to do and understand. 100/100

Final 
{
This final was very simple, the only hard part was operant++ and increiment , for operant ++ i used chat gpt to understand why Word temp(*this) works and how to impliment it correctly, i figured out that you are making a new word that just copies te current word you have, aside from those two the other segments were very simple and easy.
100/100.
