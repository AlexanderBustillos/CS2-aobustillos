Game of Life
{
British mathematician John Conway created the Game of Life in 1970. The game is a cellular automaton and a zero-player game where the evolution is determined by its initial state.
100/100, everything works perfectly fine the way it was intended, the cells move the way they are supposed to and the code is written well enough with comments that explain everything happening in the code showing I understand what is happening and what I wrote down.
The game of life follows simple rules that make cells come to life and work together moving around, with my code the game of life was replicated and does what is intended for the code to do.
